/// This problem consists of approaching a moving ball with an omni-directional
/// wheeled robot.
///
/// The state space is the following (all data are provided in robot referential):
/// - state[0:1] -> position of the ball (x,y)
/// - state[2:3] -> position of the target (x,y)
/// - state[4:6] -> speed of the robot (x,y,theta)
/// - state[7:8] -> speed of the ball (x,y)
/// - state[9]   -> Kicking tolerance (do not change at each step)
///
/// There are two different setups for the problem: see Mode
/// - Wide: The ball starts at a random orientation with a random speed and
///         robot is stationary
/// - Finish: The robot start with the ball in front of him, roughly aligned
///           toward the goal target, robot is moving at a speed similar to
///           the ball speed
