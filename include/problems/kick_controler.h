/// In this problem, one or several humanoid robots play versus a static goalie.
/// At each time step, they have to choose:
/// - Which player will kick?
/// - Which type of kick will he use? (Power kick, accurate kick, lateral kick etc...)
/// - What parameters will be used for the kick? (kick_direction etc)
/// - What targets will be used for the non-kicker robots
///   - Target_x, target_y, target_theta
///
/// Referentials:
/// - x axis: from kickers goal to the opposite goal
/// - y axis: moving laterally on the field (z aims to the ceiling)
/// - (0,0) is the center of the field
///
/// The state space is the following:
/// 0    : ball_x
/// 1    : ball_y
/// 2+3*k: position x of robot k
/// 3+3*k: position y of robot k
/// 4+3*k: direction  of robot k
///
/// Actions identifiers:
/// 0-n: Who will kick with what kick options
///
/// TRANSITION FUNCTION:
/// The following transition function is used:
/// 1. The ball is moved from *ball* to *ball_real* by adding noise on the ball position.
///    - This simulates the fact that the position of the ball is unknown
///      - Not perfectly correct, but partial observability is not modeled in this framework
/// 2. If *ball_real* is outside of the field:
///    a) The segment *ball* to *ball_real* intersect with the goal segment
///       - A goal is scored and a specific value is returned (cf. below)
///    b) The segment *ball* to *ball_real* do not intersect with the goal segment
///       - A failure is detected and a specific value is returned (cf. below)
/// 3. Simulate the kicker approach using the appropriate policy
/// 4. Randomized shoot:
///    - *ball_final* is computed from *ball_real* using the kick_model and the parameters
/// 5. Simulate motions of the non-kicker robots
/// 6. If *ball_final* is outside of the field, the same process as in 2. is used
///
/// DISCLAIMER: using the simulate_approaches is currently unsupported
